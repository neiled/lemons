Web based
Clicking and typing based
Economy Based
Loot based? (Some random return on time-investment)
Player-Player buying/selling/interaction
Faction/Guild/Groups of players
Time-locked steps (buildings take time to build etc...)

When you start the game you are given a unique recipe
Someone else who joins after will need that item to build one of their starter items

Start the game
Manually build an item
Sell the item

Higer level players don't want to waste time making the low level stuff so they will buy it
Example:
	Bricks take 5 seconds to build
	Players need hundereds of bricks to build a factory, therefore buy the bricks
	
Do I want users to sell directly to other players, or put onto a market?
Market would be putting them on at a certain price, someone can buy them

Research can find new recipes, it takes time
Recipe's have various rarities

Where is the skill?
	
Who is going to buy the higher level products?

Is all money taken from other players? Yes
	Every player starts with X amount of gold.
	Each time a player joins that gold is added to the available pool.
	
What happens if you have 0 gold?
	Manual labor allows you to generate money (i.e. clicking to build something with no costs)
	

Example:
Click * 10 - build a brick
10 Bricks - build a furnace
Furnace builds bricks in 1 click

With money from selling bricks, buy some iron ore
Use iron ore and furnace to build iron
Use bricks and iron to build an iron miner
Can now click * 10 to build iron ore
